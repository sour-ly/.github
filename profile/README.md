## Sour-ly

!~Hi~!, Welcome to Sour-ly.

Sour-ly aims to be a multi-platform application that allows users to create, log, and track the progress on their skills through gamification. Sour-ly rewards users with EXP and levels up their skills (and themselves) as they progress. Skills can be anything from learning a new language, to improving your social skills, or even learning how to play an instrument. Skills are leveled up by assigning goals to them. Completing goals will reward the user and the skill with EXP. 

### Try it out 

Sour-ly is currently in development (pre-alpha) and is not yet ready for public use. It is very far from what we want it to be. However, if you want to try the core idea out and leave feedback, you can download the latest version from the [sourly-electron repository](https://github.com/sour-ly/sourly-electron/.) 

All feedback is appreciated.

### Features (Currently)
- Skills can be created, updated, and deleted.
- Skills can be leveled up by completing goals.
- Goals can be created, updated, and deleted.
- Goals can be marked as complete.
- Users have their own profile page that displays their skills and their levels.
- Users can level up by gaining EXP from logging goals and leveling up Skills.

### Features (Future)

There's a lot we want to add to Sour-ly. Here are some of the major features we want to implement in the future:
- Virtual World Space, an isometric "home" for the user to decorate, customize, and invite friends to. These spaces will be a coworking zone where users can join and work on their skills together.
- Inventory and Drop System, users can earn items that can be used to customize their profile and Virtual Space.
- Quests, users can take on quests together to earn rewards.
- Friends List, users can add friends and see their progress.
- Integrity. We want to make sure that users are not cheating the system, abusing the EXP system, or exploiting the drop system. We want to make sure all users have a genuine experience in their journey.  
- Much More.

### Platforms
Currently, Sour-ly is being developed for the following platforms:
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

In the future we want to develop Sour-ly for the mobile platforms:
- Android
- iOS
- iPadOS
- (in a perfect world) Apple WatchOS
